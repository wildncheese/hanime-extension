# hanime-extension
An extension for hanime.tv. 

This was created so i could view the many images on hamine with ease and i thought maybe someone else would also like to use it.. 
Hope you enjoy ^-^

**This is my first time writing a chrome extension so there may be a few bugs here and there and the code is not perfect in anyway.**
